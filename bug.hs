This Haskell code suffers from a subtle error related to lazy evaluation and infinite lists:

```haskell
import Data.List (intersect)

containsElement :: (Eq a) => a -> [a] -> Bool
containsElement x xs = not $ null $ intersect [x] xs

main :: IO ()
main = do
  print (containsElement 5 [1,2,3,4,5]) --Correctly prints True
  print (containsElement 5 [1..]) -- Incorrectly hangs or runs forever
```

The `intersect` function, when given an infinite list (`[1..]`), will attempt to compare `x` to every element in the infinite list. If `x` is present, it will eventually find it. However, if `x` is not in the list, it will run forever because it will never reach the end of the infinite list.
